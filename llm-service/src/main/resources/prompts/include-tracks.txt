Use the following prompt format:

    Use the following tracks to inspire the playlist:
    {{tracks}}

Additional Rules:

    Treat the provided tracks as inspiration for the playlist’s mood, style, genre, and emotional tone.

    Do not include the same tracks in the final playlist unless explicitly requested.

    Avoid repeating artists from the inspiration tracks unless it’s clearly justified by the theme.

    The resulting playlist should feel like a curated extension of the inspiration—capturing the same vibe while introducing new, real, and interesting tracks that would appeal to someone who enjoys the input songs.

    Maintain full adherence to all existing rules (e.g., artist uniqueness, platform availability, JSON format, track variety, etc.).
