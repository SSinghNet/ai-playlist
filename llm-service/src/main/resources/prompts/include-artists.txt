    {{artists}}

Additional Rules for Artist-Inspired Playlists:

    Use the sound, mood, and genre associations of the listed artists to guide the playlist curation.

    Do not include tracks by the inspiration artists themselves unless explicitly requested.

    You may include collaborators or artists with strong musical similarity or shared fanbases.

    The playlist should feel like something a fan of the provided artists would love—similar energy, production style, or lyrical themes, while staying fresh.

    Be especially mindful to:

        Include a balanced mix of well-known and lesser-known artists with similar appeal.

        Avoid over-saturating with just one subgenre unless that’s the user’s theme.

    Maintain all existing strict rules (e.g., artist uniqueness in final list, track quantity, JSON formatting, and review quality).
